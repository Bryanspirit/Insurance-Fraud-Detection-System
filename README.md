Multi-Level Insurance Fraud Detection System
 Goal:
Detect potentially fraudulent claims and identify suspicious behavior from employees and vendors, including possible collusion between them.
# Insurance Fraud Detection System

🔍 A machine learning-based system for detecting potentially fraudulent insurance claims using unsupervised learning.

---

##  Project Goal

The goal of this project is to:
- Detect suspicious insurance claims
- Identify risky agent/vendor behavior
- Flag potential collusion between agents and vendors
- Help reduce financial losses due to fraud

This system uses **unsupervised anomaly detection techniques** since labeled fraud data may not always be available.

---

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset includes three main files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `employee_data.csv` | Information about insurance agents handling claims |
| `vendor_data.csv` | Details about third-party vendors involved in claim processing |
| `insurance_data.csv` | Transaction-level insurance claim data |

###  Relationships
- Claims are linked to employees via `AGENT_ID`
- Claims are linked to vendors via `VENDOR_ID`

---

## Features Used

We engineered features such as:
- `claim_to_premium_ratio`: Claim amount vs premium paid
- `agent_claim_count`, `agent_avg_claim_amount`
- `vendor_claim_count`, `vendor_avg_claim_amount`
- Incident severity flags
- Police report availability
- Nighttime/weekend claims

---

## 🤖 Modeling Approach

Since we don't have labeled fraud cases, we used **unsupervised learning** methods:

- **Isolation Forest**: For identifying outliers based on deviation from normal patterns
- (Optional) **DBSCAN Clustering**: If working environment supports it
- Feature normalization and PCA for visualization
